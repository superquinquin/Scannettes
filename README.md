## Contributions Guideslines
All development efforts are put into v1.0 branch, unless we need to fix a bug in production.

### How to contribute
* Create a branch based on v1.0. name your branch after the feature/fix you want to implement. prefix the branch witht the kind of change you will add ( feature/xxx ; fix/xxx ; etc.. )
* For any contribution over the python parts, make sure to use formatter such as [BLack Formatter](https://github.com/psf/black) and [Flake8 Linter](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)
  * Some pre-commit hooks will be added when I have the time to switch from pipenv to Poetry build.
*  Similarly for JS however, I don't know any tools nor did proper formatting myself yet.
*  Format your commits using tools such as [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or any equivalent tools.
*  PR must heads towards the v1.0 branch

### On what to contribute
Maybe those points will pop as Github issues if I have the time.

**Backend**
* [ ] move from PipEnv to Poetry. propagate those changes in the Docker file.
* [x] Better config system and config injection.
* [ ] Config validation ( probably in CUE lang )
* [ ] Env variable parser for injecting those into the config yaml at run time.
* [x] Authentication System based On JWT. Controle admin endpoint access.
* [ ] More consistent variable naming accross Backend & Frontend.
* [ ] Tracking system for logging catched errors.
* [ ] in extension to previous bullet, build up exceptions
* [x] Refactor Logging system
* [x] Refactor Caching, Backup and Update system
* [ ] Continue Mailing system ( mainly for allerting bugs, very low priority )
* [ ] Continue Refactoring models, odoo connector and event handling.
...

**Frontend**
* [ ] Make lobby responsive
* [ ] Retemplate Room elements (lobby) to make few useful data as attribute rather than hidden html elements...
* [ ] Retemplate Room product container to few useful data as attribute rather than hidden html elements... as well as better and more consistent container design.
* [ ] Solve Camera environment camera bug ( camera doesn't switch to environment )
* [ ] revisit Camera barcode scanner to maybe process the barcode on client side.
* [ ] Reformat JS code base
* [ ] Restructure JS code base, maybe using Lit or other very small JS framework ( preferable to be loadable via CDN ).

## Installation
### Setup
```bash
mkdir inventaire
cd inventaire
git clone https://github.com/superquinquin/inventory-bl-scanner-webapp.git
mkdir volume
chmod 777 volume
```
### Configuration
* `cannettes_configs/cannettes_config.yaml` Is the main configuration file that will be injected in the app during init time.
* `cannettes_configs/secrets.yaml` will contains all your internal admin users credentials
* `.env` will contains all api secrets and credentials for running the app. Those will be parsed and exported in `cannettes_config.yaml` at init time.

#### Scannettes configurations
```bash
nano cannettes_configs/cannettes_config.yaml.example
```
* Flask configuration : [Flask server parameters](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Flask)
* Flask Soketio configuration : [Flask SocketIo parameters](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#flask_socketio.SocketIO)
* Authentication JWT cookie configuration : [Cookie](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Response.set_cookie)

For env variable that will be imported into the configuration file, annotate ${<ENV_VAR_NAME>} for the specific fields you want to apply as an env variable. The config parser will retrieve and fill the config file with the env variables

#### Env
```bash
nano .env.example
```
Output the .env file after filling the diff√©rents ENV variable. It is recommended to set Odoo api credentials and SMTP server credentials as env variable.

#### Create Users
```bash
python set_users_config.py
```
Following the directives of the tool for creating admin users for the applications.

This tool will generate a `cannettes_configs/secrets.yaml` containing all the admin app users.

You can whenever you want add a new users to by reusing the tool. It will automatically append this new user to the current list of users

For removing users, `nano cannettes_configs/secrets.yaml` and manually remove the users you want to delete.

### Docker-compose
```bash
nano docker-compose.yml.template
```
Save your docker-compose file as `docker-compose.yml`. No particular inputs are needed unless you want to custumize further your docker setup.

### Launching
Once the applications is configurated:
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
